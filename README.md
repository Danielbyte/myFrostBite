# About
This is a `Frostbite Atari 2600` game clone coded in `C++ (ISO C++ 20 Standard)` and `SFML 2.5.1` library. No `OpenGL` and or frameworks built ontop of SFML were used for this project. The game code can be easily scaled up to include levels. External contributions are welcome. Cheeers :smiley:!
